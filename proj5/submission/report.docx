Notable Obstacles:
    Initially setting the enviornment for multifile cpp projects took some time, working in VSCode it wasn't that straight forward

    Testing the code was also a challenge. Due to the nature of the program, there was no easy/straight-forward way to test the full program,
    the best way I found to do it was to build the program slowly, testing each individual part.

    The centeral aspect of the program, counting stars and planets, was also decently difficult. Keeping track of the index and comparisons was not easy.

Design:
    runOneRound()
        check validity of inputs -> if nWords and wordNum have correct values
        while word not correct:
            get user input
            check validity of user input
            check if word is correct
                if correct return number of tries
            count stars
                loop through both strings
                    add stars and remove char at index if chars are the same
            count planets  
                loop through trialWord
                    loop through word
                        if char is trialword is found in word 
                            remove both and move on to next char in trial word
    
    main()
        Get word array
        check if number of words is less than 1
        get number of rounds
        check if number of rounds is positive
        init variables max, min, and average
        looping for each rounds
            run runOneRound
            update max min and average based off output
